# responsive-design-final

In this exercise, I was given a simple page and I have made it completely responsive. I used media queries to rearrange and resize the html parts according to the screen size. I have also changed the layout of some elements (table and list are displayed in rows) when its display is not suitable due to insufficient size of the element. For the small mobile screen the nav menu is hidden and can be displayed via the “hamburger menu“, which appears automatically.
